# BandFish
Bandfish is a conceptual spin off of BandCamp done by Joe Rashid. This project incorporates my favorite aspects of the BandCamp website, and includes in-depth feature emulation of its real-life counterpart. 
- Users can browse the website to find an album or a podcast they enjoy, and stream the tracks from that group for their enjoyment. Upon signing up, a user can choose a profile picture avatar for themselves, as well as a banner for their profile's page.
```txt
ℹ️ Podcasts are treated like an album, albeit with a larger collection of tracks, the same way that Spotify or iTunes classify Podcasts.
```
- Users can "shop" for albums or podcasts, and add them to their cart. They can complete a simplified checkout process. Users can add podcasts or albums to their wishlist from the details page of that track group.
- Bandfish supports user-created content as well, allowing artists to publish their work and host their albums on the site.
